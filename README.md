> A menu bar app to check if Internet is ✅ Online or ❌ Offline

It is written in Swift. This is my 2nd project made for fun when my internet become shitty.

Initially I used [is-online-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/is-online-cli) by [@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) but my internet sucked too much & it was constantly going offline & online. So after a little while, I got bored of typing `is-online` in Terminal all the time to check if my internet is up or not.

So I made this little app which will looks like traffic signal for the internet connection.

It will be 🍏 Green if internet is **Online**, 🔴 Red if its **Offline** & 💛 Yellow if there is an error while connecting.

If you like this app, checkout my 1st app also made in Swift called [Away From Keyboard (AFK)](https://akshaykadam.me/apps/away-from-keyboard/?ref=github)

AFK is for anyone who works for a long time on a computer to reduce eye strain by getting reminded by AFK to take a break.
