# net-alert

> A menu bar app to check if Internet is ✅ Online or ❌ Offline

It is written in Swift. This is my 2nd project made for fun when my internet become shitty.

Initially I used [is-online](https://github.com/sindresorhus/is-online) by [@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) but my internet sucked too much & it was constantly going offline & online.

So I made this little app which will acts like traffic signal for the internet connection.

It will be Green if Internet is Online, Red if its Offline & Yellow if there is an Error while connecting.

If you like this app, checkout my 1st app also made in Swift called [Away From Keyboard (AFK)](https://akshaykadam.me/apps/away-from-keyboard/?ref=github). AFK is for anyone who works for a long time on a computer to reduce eye strain by getting reminded by AFK to take a break.
